# Kunst und Krebs
The project files for lighting as part of the Kunst und Krebs exhibition

This consists of:
* bill of materials for the hardware
* software used in modulation

The goal of this lighting is to:
* provide sufficient UV (395nm) illumination of the piece to generate visible amounts of fluorescence under normal lighting conditions
* modulate the amount of fluorescence generated to match a chosen pattern

## Developers
The Arduino code can be built and deployed using the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
